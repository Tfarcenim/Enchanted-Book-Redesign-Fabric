# Enchanted-Book-Redesign
Ever notice how all enchanted books are the same color with no way to tell them apart or even how strong they are?

This mod aims to fix that issue by changing the ribbon/glint colors to match the types of items that the enchants can go on and changing the textures of the enchanted books to reflect the level of them.
